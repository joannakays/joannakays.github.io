I had little understanding of how the female body works during labour and was unable to remain calm when things didn't quite go the way I thought they would. Luckily for me my baby was born healthy and happy but I felt disconnected from his birth and my body and constantly wondered what I could have done to prevent this. When I fell pregnant with my second child in 2015 I decided straight away I wanted a different experience and so signed up to a Hypnobirthing class. I learnt all about my body and mind during pregnancy and labour and how I could peacefully and calmly welcome my baby earthside. I even ended up having a home birth! It was such a life changing, empowering experience that I decided there and then that I wanted to help other women to experience this calmness during their pregnancy and labour.</p> </div> </div> </body> </html>
