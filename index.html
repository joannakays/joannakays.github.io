        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jo Snellin and my aim is to guide you through a happy and calm pregnancy to a happy and calm birth</p>

    <p>I have two children, my first was born in 2013 at hospital, under strip lighting and with all of the drugs! I had little understanding of how the female body works during labour and was unable to remain calm when things didn't quite go the way I thought they would. Luckily for me my baby was born healthy and happy but I felt disconnected from his birth and my body and constantly wondered what I could have done to prevent this. When I fell pregnant with my second child in 2015 I decided straight away I wanted a different experience and so signed up to a Hypnobirthing class. I learnt all about my body and mind during pregnancy and labour and how I could peacefully and calmly welcome my baby earthside. I even ended up having a home birth! It was such a life changing, empowering experience that I decided there and then that I wanted to help other women to experience this calmness during their pregnancy and labour.</p>

    <p>Peaceful babies have peaceful births and I would love to work with you towards this beautiful event.</p>
