 <h2 class="section__heading">About me</h2> <img class="section_image" src=> <p class="section__text"> My name is Jo Snellin and my aim is to guide you through a happy and calm pregnancy to a happy and calm birth. <p class="section__text"> I became passionate about birth and the magic of the female body and all it can achieve after the birth of my two children. My first son was born in 2013 at hospital, under strip lighting and with all of the drugs! I had very little understanding of how the female body works during labour and was unable to remain calm when things didn't quite go the way I thought they would. Luckily for me my baby was born healthy and happy but I felt disconnected from his birth and my body and constantly wondered what I could have done to prevent this. So, when I fell pregnant with my second son in 2015 I decided straight away that I wanted a different experience, so signed up to a Hypnobirthing class. <p class="section__text"> I learnt all about my body and the power of the mind and how if I allowed them to work together naturally and harmoniously during labour I could peacefully and calmly welcome my baby earthside. It was such a life changing, empowering experience that I decided there and then that I wanted to help other women experience this calmness during their pregnancy and labour. <p class="section__text"> If you are interested in one of my courses or have any questions please contact me via my Contact Me page. You can also find me on Instagram and Twitter @thehappybirthguide </p> </div> </div> </body> </html>
